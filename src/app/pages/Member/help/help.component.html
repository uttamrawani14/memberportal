                                    Life insurance coverage is a means of protection from financial loss that could
                                    occur due to the death of the insured individual. When you apply for your policy,
                                    you designate “beneficiaries” - individuals or entities (such as a trust or estate)
                                    to receive the payout of death benefit funds. In many cases, this money can be
                                    critical to assisting the beneficiaries with household expenses, debt and other
                                    financial obligations that your income previously supported.

                                    The most important reason to buy life insurance is to help establish a foundation of
                                    financial security that could provide money to care for and support your dependents
                                    (such as young children, non-working spouses or elderly parents) should you die.
                                    Aside from dealing with grief in their loss, they also would have to manage through
                                    any financial impact from your passing. Life insurance can be an important tool to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Replace income for dependents: If family members depend on your income,
                                            life insurance can replace that income or a portion of it to bridge a
                                            financial gap in the household</li>
                                        <li>Pay funeral expenses: Life insurance can help pay your funeral and burial
                                            costs as well as any associated costs.</li>
                                        <li>Fulfill debt obligations: Funds from life insurance can assist in paying
                                            outstanding debts including credit cards, loans, mortgage and other similar
                                            obligations.</li>
                                        <li>Pay federal "death" taxes and state "death" taxes: Death benefit funds can
                                            help cover potential estate taxes so that your heirs will not have to
                                            liquidate other assets or take a smaller inheritance.</li>
                                        <li>Create a source of savings: Certain types of life insurance accumulate a
                                            cash value that can be borrowed or withdrawn by the policy owner while the
                                            policy is in force.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    You should consider term life insurance if:

                                    • You need life insurance protection for a specific period of time. Term life
                                    coverage offers you the flexibility to align the amount of time you’ll need coverage
                                    to the length of the term policy. For example, if you have young children and want
                                    to ensure that - should you not be there to provide funds to pay for their education
                                    or their care until they are grown, you might buy a 20-year term life policy. Or if
                                    you need funds to repay a debt (such as a mortgage or school loans) within a
                                    specific period of time (20-year loan), a term policy may be a good option for you.

                                    provide for those you leave behind, then term life may offer that balance.

                                    Life insurance coverage is a means of protection from financial loss that could
                                    occur due to the death of the insured individual. When you apply for your policy,
                                    you designate “beneficiaries” - individuals or entities (such as a trust or estate)
                                    to receive the payout of death benefit funds. In many cases, this money can be
                                    critical to assisting the beneficiaries with household expenses, debt and other
                                    financial obligations that your income previously supported.

                                    The most important reason to buy life insurance is to help establish a foundation of
                                    financial security that could provide money to care for and support your dependents
                                    (such as young children, non-working spouses or elderly parents) should you die.
                                    Aside from dealing with grief in their loss, they also would have to manage through
                                    any financial impact from your passing. Life insurance can be an important tool to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Replace income for dependents: If family members depend on your income,
                                            life insurance can replace that income or a portion of it to bridge a
                                            financial gap in the household</li>
                                        <li>Pay funeral expenses: Life insurance can help pay your funeral and burial
                                            costs as well as any associated costs.</li>
                                        <li>Fulfill debt obligations: Funds from life insurance can assist in paying
                                            outstanding debts including credit cards, loans, mortgage and other similar
                                            obligations.</li>
                                        <li>Pay federal "death" taxes and state "death" taxes: Death benefit funds can
                                            help cover potential estate taxes so that your heirs will not have to
                                            liquidate other assets or take a smaller inheritance.</li>
                                        <li>Create a source of savings: Certain types of life insurance accumulate a
                                            cash value that can be borrowed or withdrawn by the policy owner while the
                                            policy is in force.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    • You need life insurance protection for a specific period of time. Term life
                                    coverage offers you the flexibility to align the amount of time you’ll need coverage
                                    to the length of the term policy. For example, if you have young children and want
                                    to ensure that - should you not be there to provide funds to pay for their education
                                    or their care until they are grown, you might buy a 20-year term life policy. Or if
                                    you need funds to repay a debt (such as a mortgage or school loans) within a
                                    specific period of time (20-year loan), a term policy may be a good option for you.

                                    Knowing how to buy permanent life insurance is very important. Your first step is to
                                    determine how much permanent life insurance you need. Since there are many
                                    variations of permanent insurance available, it is equally vital that you carefully
                                    shop around. Consider the options and format of the policy you choose, as the costs
                                    as can vary considerably from one life insurance Company to another. Your best
                                    approach is to work with an independent agent in the Trusted Choice network who can
                                    do the comparison shopping for you and help you buy the right permanent life
                                    insurance policy for your needs at the best rates.
